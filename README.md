"Global market sentiment and exchange rates: evidence from Twitter"
Advised by Prof. Dr. Mathias Hoffmann & Nicola Benigni

Abstract:
This paper investigates the extent to which market sentiment expressed on Twitter correlates to
exchange rate and stock market movements. The main variable of interest is the broad-dollar indexâ€“a
trade-weighted index of the US dollar against a basket of other major currencies. Global central bank
sentiment is found to be a meaningful indicator of dollar depreciations as measured by this index.
The paper goes on to compare the effects of the posts of individual central banks on domestic and
foreign stock indexes. The paper attempts to use idiosyncratic central bank sentiment as a proxy for
the stochastic discount factor. This second goal proves to be inconclusive due to data availability
constraints.
